# Student Assignment Solutions
This is your personal student repository which will be used to submit solutions for the course's 
various assignments, both labs and the final project. This repo is completely private, meaning none 
other than you and the teachers have access to it. As you've completed a particular assignment and 
wish to have its solution evaluated, you'll need to perform a formal hand-in using the dedicated 
submission box in Moodle. Nothing should be attached to this submission in Moodle, as the current 
project state will be fetched from this repository, so make sure to synchronize any local changes 
with **remote origin** before submission.

> Refer to the examples repository if you want some tips in regards to configuring appearance and
Markdown rendering in PyCharm!

## Structure of Repository

````
studid_solutions/   (1)
  _Playground/      (2)
  _Resources/       (3)
  Laboration_X/     (4)
  Project/          (5)
  .gitignore        (6)
  README.md         (7)

Laboration_X/       (8)
  assignment.py     (9)
  README.md         (10)
````

1. Root of repository.
3. All contents in this folder will be ignored by version control, as long as the ``.gitignore`` 
remains untouched. This is a good place to just play around with scripts, which are not meant to be viewed by others.
3. This is where resource files will be stored and retrieved.
4. Directory for laboration content, further explained in points ``8 - 10``. 
5. Root directory for final project, details of which will be described once project assignment has 
been published.
6. Patterns to be ignored from version control, such as project files generated by the IDE. Existing 
contents of this file should be general enough to cover most circumstances, but feel free to add 
more if the need arises.
7. The document you're currently reading.
8. Main folder for laboration content, where 'X' indicate a sequence number. There are a total of 
three lab assignments in the course and you find relevant exercise documents directly under each root.
9. Python document which needs to contain implementations for your solution to the corresponding lab 
assignment.
10. **README** which needs to contain a written report, in conformity to requirements which are 
stated in study guidance. 


--------------

## Branching
The first laboration will require you to conduct work in a dedicated development branch, but you are 
encouraged to continue with such workflow for the remaining assignments as well. It will properly 
isolate development and enable greater degree of experimentation since more stable states are 
readily available at all times. Do note, however, that examination will only be performed on the
solutions which exists in the main branch (**master**), without any exceptions. It's therefore vital
that you always remember to merge any development branches with **master** upon submission.


--------------

## Statical Analysis
Feedback from evaluations will be published in Moodle and beginning from the second assignment, 
parts of it will be generated using [**Pylint**](https://www.pylint.org/). Outcomes from such 
analysis will always be presented at the end of feedback, and studying it will not be mandatory. Any
divergences or violations which needs attending will be stated in the first part of the feedback, 
while the analysis is more aimed towards making you comfortable with convention conformity.

If you want to use **PyLint**, it can be install using **PIP**...

````
pip install -U pylint
````

... and running an analysis of code can be done simply by stating path to the file in question:

````
pylint Laboration_2/assignment.py
````

If you run this analysis on the document in its inherent state it will produce a lot of issues, with
the low score of **``3.33 / 10``**. The score tells you how well the implementation conforms to 
conventions and coding standards, and should be raised as you work with the solution and attend to 
the issues which are emphasized. 

Each time you run the analysis, you will also be presented with the changes in score since the last 
run, but don't invest too much time chasing perfect scores. The analysis should give you some 
pointers and sometimes it's better to simply ignore particular issues. 

One example here would be to determine whether a string contains a substring, and store the results
in a new variable:

````
exists = True if substr in text else False
````

This chained statement is expressive and clearly conveys that the data type should be a boolean. 
PyLint will however urge that you replace it with a simplified test, with data type implicitly 
determined:

````
exists = substr in text
````

There's nothing wrong in being explicit and it's especially helpful during the process of learning 
how to program. Give yourself some room for flexibility and expressiveness, and be content with 
PyLint scores above **``8.0``** since that indicate a boundary of _**good enough**_.
